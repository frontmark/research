## :chains: [BlockVisualisation](BlockVisualisation)

Source code of an algorithm to efficiently visualize graphs with a very high number of nodes and edges. In our experiments, this algorithm produced meaningful graphs within a reasonable amount of computing time, while other algorithms were not applicable due to their computational complexity.

Although developed for analyzing bitcoin blockchain data, it may be worth applying this algorithm to other blockchain transaction graphs or large graphs from other domains.
